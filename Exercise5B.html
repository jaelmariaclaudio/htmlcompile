<p style="font-family:georgia;">Bicol Express is my pure comfort food. Its taste is from the authenticity of Bicol.  It definitely deserves to carry the name of the province of Bicol, known in the Philippines for a lot of things such as the perfect coned, Mayon volcano, Pili nuts and, of course, for their love of spicy food.The taste of this dish will surely get your tongue up on fire. Its rich, creamy, and spicy taste is really good and satisfying. This dish is served with steamed rice for a hearty and big flavored meal.<br>
